              With an average age of 19, they have showed drastic success with
              their new generation talents. Unlike typical bands they have been
              taking in and blending various genres such as emo/screamo/metal/
              and dance tunes. Stuffed with numerous genres and originality, it
              goes without saying that their music is what’s called “chaos”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mixed with a dynamic melody of clean vocals and destructive
              shouts, the combination of this unique twin vocal style has shown
              a dramatic approach to the audiences. Their hot and steamy live
              performances, at all times exceeding boiling point have been
              burning the dancing crowd; flooded with live offers all over
              Japan.
